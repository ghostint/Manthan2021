the performance ad industry is intentionally very obscure with little transparency and whatever data they share is muddled
there was a good podcast done by freakonomics on this recently this means that doubling the amount of advertising would lead to about a by percent increase in sales
and ebay earlier their findings suggest that many paid ads generate virtually no increase in sales and even for ones that do the sales benefits are far eclipsed by the cost of the ads themselves
and p amp g when p amp g turned off million of their digital ad spending they saw no change in business outcomes
there was this case of uber discovering ad fraud we turned off of our spend we turned off million of annual spend out of and basically saw no change
big popular brands getting little out of performance spends has been a discovery recently there have been quite a few case studies now

premature optimization is pretty common hard to argue with not making code even better but it is also something that you come to recognize with experience realizing this can increase mileage especially in early stage startups

you obviously want to hire smart people and let them make decisions but sometimes there is a lot on stake or the things being done have never been done before and micromanagement may be justified it is not ok for regular tasks

twitter stand by for bangalore weather tweets just refresh you feed
   the dumbest people on twitter are commenting at me this week that my opinions on are not credible because
shutting down the economy is a big conundrum for a big country like india but we should be looking for a gradual opening of the economy post lockdown to prevent long term damage to the informal sector
while full shutdown was the right step to manage a highly contagious disease in a country of billion people india should look to open the economy gradually to prevent long term impact on informal economy
informal economy is big in india and employs the poor to prevent a total collapse we should be looking for staggered relaxation soon
in general any activity not involving gathering more than people should qualify to be opened we should follow that for weeks and then assess
daily life grocery stores should operate with masks and social distancing blue collar jobs like cooks maids plumbers should resume
delivery food delivery ecommerce deliveries should be allowed
transportation private vehicles can be allowed auto ola uber should be allowed buses get crowded fast and difficult to maintain social distance it should remain closed in phase
office people who work in corporate are among the least affected from an economic standpoint among this there s a section of people who can work from home those who can t should remain closed
schools malls restaurants should stay closed in phase till we understand the impact of gradual relaxation
gathering any gathering of more than people should still be avoided
travel inter city travel should be banned trains flights intercity buses should be on hold activities within a city should function with restrictions
those who can not get the masks due to distribution issues shortage should build one any mask is better than going out without it
masks to begin with masks should be mandatory for everybody outside home govt should make free masks available to everyone distribution will be key if we can give condoms for free to control hiv aids we can do masks too
as we approach the second half of lockdown we need to think about how to deal with the situation after india is a poor country and can not afford to shut down completely for long we need to open gradually that is a staggered approach
india has done well by acting early and cutting off from the world and then full internal lockdown it s been chaotic but a better approach until we understand the full impact of across the world
like all complex problems this presents a formidable challenge you have to choose the less bad situation and like many other complex situations this also needs a tailored approach specific to india
opening fully will infect a mass majority sooner or later with india s substandard healthcare system again poor people will be the most adversely affected
with india faces a peculiar situation if full lockdown is continued this will hamper the economy in a big way informal economy is hit hardest informal economy employs the poor and they are having a hard time just surviving

haha the world is a funny place
   if you don t care to be liked they can t touch you
this grave situation demands open mindedness and ability to find the right solution at each stage irrespective of who is the leader
we have shut our minds to any independent thinking it is as if we are in an idea prison and can t think beyond the artificial walls we have constructed
the people who love modi or kejriwal are busy explaining their every move even the faulty ones
the people who hate modi or kejriwal are busy hating him finding faults with everything they do selectively sharing the news which confirm their biases
it is funny how rigid we are in our thinking and the current situation is no different

now would be the perfect time to bring out those drones and autonomous vehicles for deliveries bring them on
haha that would be quite a comeback
hope we are able to regain that pride and sensibility as a nation fast enough to prevent a meltdown
if one looks at the history and goes back to indus valley civilisation maurya dynasty gupta dynasty etc we have been one of the best run countries and among the largest economies up to of the world gdp somewhere we have lost the path
i wonder why is this the case indians are one of the most capable people in the world running numerous large companies in india and internationally why then are we not able to fix our social problems
of course there are exceptions and lot of doctors nurses policemen and other people helping the needed but one would think that one of the largest economies in the world is able to take care of its people in a better way
and these are not isolated incidents this is the normal situation sad part is that none of it is surprising to ordinary citizen how the state handles this situation determines how much trust citizens place in the authority next time around
citizens are left helpless in case of healthcare need
while the state has announced lockdown there are thousands of stranded with no plan or help
educated citizens are defying police despite a clear message of lockdown
there are numerous examples of
this has been a mirror to the indian society even after years we have not figured out a working social order
profiles seem genuine but people are copy pasting the message to show their human side and garner some engagement along the way it s a weird world

i am the indian middle class
this lockdown will also give indian middle class dad a chance to spend more than quality time with their kids hope they make good use of it
while days is too less to change any behaviour maybe some learnings will be carried over
indian middle class became successful on the back of the struggle they endured during their lives their kids are a pampered lot devoid of any struggle and what would make of their future is unknown indian middle class parent is in unchartered territory
for the entitled kids of indian middle class sharing household chores this will be their first brush with hard work for their entire childhood parents have been telling the kids how life was tough in our time for the kids this will be their first first hand experience
during this indian middle class will re learn the value of hard work after a long time they will be doing household chores on their own without ever present help

we need a revolution to change the status quo dramatically
one of the reasons india is still poor decades after independence is that we lack decisive political leadership occasionally right decisions will be taken under modi slightly more right decisions but at this pace it will take decades to become a well oiled machine

the performance ad industry is intentionally very obscure with little transparency and whatever data they share is muddled
there was a good podcast done by freakonomics on this recently this means that doubling the amount of advertising would lead to about a by percent increase in sales
and ebay earlier their findings suggest that many paid ads generate virtually no increase in sales and even for ones that do the sales benefits are far eclipsed by the cost of the ads themselves
and p amp g when p amp g turned off million of their digital ad spending they saw no change in business outcomes
there was this case of uber discovering ad fraud we turned off of our spend we turned off million of annual spend out of and basically saw no change
big popular brands getting little out of performance spends has been a discovery recently there have been quite a few case studies now

consistency for consistency s sake is stupid being a user for both the screens i find this a very good design the two use cases are different and in some ways it is a bold decision to not being consistent across screens if it does not make sense
for the most part it is probably a futile attempt to run away from facebook but this move from whatsapp to signal telegram is more about signaling on privacy than any material impact long term it is better to not have one company control too much and this might help

this is a very different kind of action to facebook and twitter banning trump they are top level apps and perhaps are right to boot off people basis content appstore and hosting services are a different deal altogether

premature optimization is pretty common hard to argue with not making code even better but it is also something that you come to recognize with experience realizing this can increase mileage especially in early stage startups
as software engineers we tend to believe if we write good code if will last forever but over time you realize that anything remotely useful a year down the line gets rewritten newer requirements newer people newer frameworks it is a never ending cycle

you obviously want to hire smart people and let them make decisions but sometimes there is a lot on stake or the things being done have never been done before and micromanagement may be justified it is not ok for regular tasks
micromanagement has got a bad rep but it is the preferred approach in some cases like inducting new people or people moving to new roles micromanage till they get full context or an incredibly difficult important task to make sure it is done right

twitter stand by for bangalore weather tweets just refresh you feed
   the dumbest people on twitter are commenting at me this week that my opinions on are not credible because
shutting down the economy is a big conundrum for a big country like india but we should be looking for a gradual opening of the economy post lockdown to prevent long term damage to the informal sector
while full shutdown was the right step to manage a highly contagious disease in a country of billion people india should look to open the economy gradually to prevent long term impact on informal economy
informal economy is big in india and employs the poor to prevent a total collapse we should be looking for staggered relaxation soon
in general any activity not involving gathering more than people should qualify to be opened we should follow that for weeks and then assess
daily life grocery stores should operate with masks and social distancing blue collar jobs like cooks maids plumbers should resume
delivery food delivery ecommerce deliveries should be allowed
transportation private vehicles can be allowed auto ola uber should be allowed buses get crowded fast and difficult to maintain social distance it should remain closed in phase
office people who work in corporate are among the least affected from an economic standpoint among this there s a section of people who can work from home those who can t should remain closed
schools malls restaurants should stay closed in phase till we understand the impact of gradual relaxation
gathering any gathering of more than people should still be avoided
travel inter city travel should be banned trains flights intercity buses should be on hold activities within a city should function with restrictions
those who can not get the masks due to distribution issues shortage should build one any mask is better than going out without it
masks to begin with masks should be mandatory for everybody outside home govt should make free masks available to everyone distribution will be key if we can give condoms for free to control hiv aids we can do masks too
as we approach the second half of lockdown we need to think about how to deal with the situation after india is a poor country and can not afford to shut down completely for long we need to open gradually that is a staggered approach
india has done well by acting early and cutting off from the world and then full internal lockdown it s been chaotic but a better approach until we understand the full impact of across the world
like all complex problems this presents a formidable challenge you have to choose the less bad situation and like many other complex situations this also needs a tailored approach specific to india
opening fully will infect a mass majority sooner or later with india s substandard healthcare system again poor people will be the most adversely affected
with india faces a peculiar situation if full lockdown is continued this will hamper the economy in a big way informal economy is hit hardest informal economy employs the poor and they are having a hard time just surviving

this grave situation demands open mindedness and ability to find the right solution at each stage irrespective of who is the leader
we have shut our minds to any independent thinking it is as if we are in an idea prison and can t think beyond the artificial walls we have constructed
the people who love modi or kejriwal are busy explaining their every move even the faulty ones
the people who hate modi or kejriwal are busy hating him finding faults with everything they do selectively sharing the news which confirm their biases

i wonder why is this the case indians are one of the most capable people in the world running numerous large companies in india and internationally why then are we not able to fix our social problems
of course there are exceptions and lot of doctors nurses policemen and other people helping the needed but one would think that one of the largest economies in the world is able to take care of its people in a better way
and these are not isolated incidents this is the normal situation sad part is that none of it is surprising to ordinary citizen how the state handles this situation determines how much trust citizens place in the authority next time around
citizens are left helpless in case of healthcare need
while the state has announced lockdown there are thousands of stranded with no plan or help
educated citizens are defying police despite a clear message of lockdown
there are numerous examples of

i am the indian middle class
this lockdown will also give indian middle class dad a chance to spend more than quality time with their kids hope they make good use of it
while days is too less to change any behaviour maybe some learnings will be carried over
indian middle class became successful on the back of the struggle they endured during their lives their kids are a pampered lot devoid of any struggle and what would make of their future is unknown indian middle class parent is in unchartered territory
for the entitled kids of indian middle class sharing household chores this will be their first brush with hard work for their entire childhood parents have been telling the kids how life was tough in our time for the kids this will be their first first hand experience
during this indian middle class will re learn the value of hard work after a long time they will be doing household chores on their own without ever present help
