Many karyakartas of Jana Sangh sacrificed their lives     Goa.     movements to oppose Kutch Agreement, Tashkent Agreement tainted by     death of Lal Bahadur Shastri, are worth mentioning. National integration     not     political slogan for us but     matter of commitment.
    1947, we got freedom from     British, but we could not get freedom from Western ideas. While opposing five-year plans based on Communist Soviet model of centralized government controls     Jana Sangh called for ‘Swadeshi Economy’     basis of which     ‘Economic Democracy’ and ‘Decentralisation’. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay called     ‘arthaayaam’ (economic dimension).
Bharatiya Jana Sangh gave     new direction to     politics trapped         debate of Western Socialism and Capitalism. Pandit Deendayal formulated an entirely Bharatiya philosophy of ‘Integral Humanism’ that     adopted     its Vijayawada national conference     1965.
    philosophy of Integral Humanism looks at     individual not merely as     material object but one who has     spiritual dimension.     talks of integral approach to economic development that has individual at its core that     linked to      ,     society and     nation.     integration of ‘vyashti, srishti, samashti, and parameshti         essence of existence of man. Centre piece of this philosophy     Antyodaya –     welfare of     last person         queue.
Secularism,     leitmotif of   n politics has been distorted beyond recognition. Secularism had emerged         West as     reaction to clash between Papal control of politics.     talks of separation of     State and Church.       , neither     there theocracy ever, nor     can be     future.   n culture         culture of ‘equal respect for all religions’.     can be translated as ‘sarva panth samabhaav’ or ‘panth nirapeksha’. Unfortunately        Secularism has been reduced to minority appeasement, that too at     cost of majority. This     what Shri Lal Krishna Advani called ‘Pseudo-Secularism’ When we say ‘Ram Rajya’ or ‘Dharma Rajya’ we mean an ethical governance based on rule of law of Constitution.         not linked to any faith or way of worship.
BJP believes that with all its short comings, Democracy         best system of governance. Deendayal ji presented           n context as     concept of ‘Chastening     Public Will’ Emergency         biggest conspiracy to undermine democracy       . Mass resistance against this onslaught         leadership of Shri Jayprakash Narayan led to restoration of democracy. As     political events that unfolded     need for collective politics     felt and Bharatiya Jana Sangh     merged         Janata Party on directive of Shri Jaiprakash Narayan, However, fear of principled cadre based Jan Sangh resulted     petty politics and Jan Sangh     eased out of Janata Party. This led to     birth of Bharatiya Janata Party.
    its first convention, BJP declared ‘Pancha Nishthas’ or five guiding principles that
would guide its political path : –
Commitment to nationalism and national integration
Commitment to Democracy
Commitment to positive secularism (sarva dharma sambhava)
Commitment to value-based politics
With time,         felt that     complete philosophy which     Jana Sangh had accepted     1965 at Vijayawada         form of ‘Integral Humanism’ expressing basic commitment       n culture should be accepted by     BJP again. Therefore, 1985 National Council accepted ‘Integral Humanism’ as its foundational principle.
Whether     governance or     opposition, BJP     committed to using constitutional means to bring out socio-economic change         society and     committed to its all-round development on     basis of Integral Humanism with ‘Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikas’ as its core belief. BJP has given space to all     sections of     society irrespective of caste and creed that can lead to     ‘samaras’ or harmonious society.
